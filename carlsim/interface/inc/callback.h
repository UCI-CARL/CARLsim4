/*! Spike generation can be performed using spike generators. Spike generators are dummy-neurons that have their spikes
 * specified externally either defined by a Poisson firing rate or via a spike injection mechanism. Spike generators can
 * have post-synaptic connections with STDP and STP, but unlike Izhikevich neurons, they do not receive any pre-synaptic
 * input. For more information on spike generators see Section Neuron groups: Spike generators in the Tutorial.
 *
 * For fine-grained control over spike generation, individual spike times can be specified per neuron in each group.
 * This is accomplished using a callback mechanism, which is called at each time step, to specify whether a neuron has

 * specifies whether a connection should be made between a pre-synaptic neuron and a post-synaptic neuron, and the
