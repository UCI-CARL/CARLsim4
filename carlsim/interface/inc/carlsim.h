	 * throughout the lifetime of the CARLsim object.
	 *
	 * CARLsim allows execution on both generic x86 CPUs and standard off-the-shelf GPUs by specifying the simulation
	 * mode (CPU_MODE and GPU_MODE, respectively). When using the latter in a multi-GPU system, the user can also
	 * specify which CUDA device to use (param numGPUs, 0-indexed).
	 *
	 * The logger mode defines where to print all status, error, and debug messages. Logger mode can either be USER (for
	 * experiment-oriented simulations), DEVELOPER (for developing and debugging code), SHOWTIME (where only warnings
	 * and errors are printed to console), SILENT (e.g., for benchmarking, where no output is generated at all), or
	 * CUSTOM (where the user can specify the file pointers of all log files).
	 * In summary, messages are printed to the following locations, depending on the logger mode:

	 * \brief Connects a presynaptic to a postsynaptic group using fixed/plastic weights and a range of delay values
	 *
	 * This function is a shortcut to create synaptic connections from a pre-synaptic group grpId1 to a post-synaptic
	 * group grpId2 using a pre-defined primitive type (such as "full", "one-to-one", or "random"). Synapse weights
	 * will stay the same throughout the simulation (SYN_FIXED, no plasticity). All synapses will have the same delay.
	 * For more flexibility, see the other connect() calls.
	 *
	 * \STATE ::CONFIG_STATE
	 * \param[in] grpId1     ID of the pre-synaptic group
	 * \param[in] grpId2     ID of the post-synaptic group
	 * \param[in] connType   connection type. "random": random connectivity. "one-to-one": connect the i-th neuron in
	 *                       pre to the i-th neuron in post. "full": connect all neurons in pre to all neurons in post.
	 *                       "full-no-direct": same as "full", but i-th neuron of grpId1 will not be connected to the
	 *                       i-th neuron of grpId2. "gaussian": distance-dependent weights depending on the RadiusRF
	 *                       struct, where neurons coding for the same location have weight initWt, and neurons lying
	 *                       on the border of the RF have weight 0.1*initWt.
	 * \param[in] wt         a struct specifying the range of weight magnitudes (initial value and max value). Weights
	 *                       range from 0 to maxWt, and are initialized with initWt. All weight values should be
	 *                       non-negative (equivalent to weight *magnitudes*), even for inhibitory connections.
	 *                       Examples:
	 *                         RangeWeight(0.1)         => all weights will be 0.1 (wt.min=0.1, wt.max=0.1, wt.init=0.1)
	 *                         RangeWeight(0.0,0.2)     => If pre is excitatory: all weights will be in range [0.0,0.2],
	 *                                                     and wt.init=0.0. If pre is inhibitory: all weights will be in
	 *                                                     range [-0.2,0.0], and wt.init=0.0.
	 *                         RangeWeight(0.0,0.1,0.2) => If pre is excitatory: all weights will be in range [0.0,0.2],
	 *                                                     and wt.init=0.1. If pre is inhibitory: all weights will be in
	 *                                                     range [-0.2,0.0], and wt.init=0.0.
	 * \param[in] connProb   connection probability
	 * \param[in] delay      A struct specifying the range of delay values (ms). Synaptic delays must be greater than or
	 *                       equal to 1 ms.
	 *                       Examples:
	 *                         RangeDelay(2) => all delays will be 2 (delay.min=2, delay.max=2)
	 *                         RangeDelay(1,10) => delays will be in range [1,10]
	 * \param[in] radRF      A struct specifying the radius of the receptive field (RF). A radius can be specified in 3
	 *                       dimensions x, y, and z (following the topographic organization of neurons as specified by
	 *                       Grid3D).
	 *                       Receptive fields will be circular with radius as specified. The 3 dimensions follow the
	 *                       ones defined by Grid3D.
	 *                       If the radius in one dimension is 0, no connections will be made in this dimension.
	 *                       If the radius in one dimension is -1, then all possible connections will be made in this
	 *                       dimension (effectively making RF of infinite size).
	 *                       Otherwise, if the radius is a positive real number, the RF radius will be exactly this
	 *                       number. Call RadiusRF with only one argument to make that radius apply to all 3 dimensions.
	 *                       Examples:
	 *                         * Create a 2D Gaussian RF of radius 10 in z-plane: RadiusRF(10, 10, 0)
	 *                           Neuron pre will be connected to neuron post iff (pre.x-post.x)^2+(pre.y-post.y)^2<=100
	 *                           and pre.z==post.z.
	 *                         * Create a 2D heterogeneous Gaussian RF (an ellipse) with semi-axes 10 and 5:
	 *                           RadiusRF(10, 5, 0)
	 *                           Neuron pre will be connected to neuron post iff
	 *                           (pre.x-post.x)/100 + (pre.y-post.y)^2/25 <= 1 and pre.z==post.z.
	 *                         * Connect all, no matter the RF (default): RadiusRF(-1, -1, -1)
	 *                         * Connect one-to-one: RadiusRF(0, 0, 0)
	 *                           Neuron pre will be connected to neuron post iff pre.x==post.x, pre.y==post.y,
	 *                           pre.z==post.z.

	 * This function allows the user to set homeostasis for a particular neuron group. All the neurons
