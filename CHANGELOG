    of CARLsim google tests in different source files instead of a single
    large source file.
  + gtest_custom_main.cpp: created this file as a custom implementation
    of a google tests main function. This allows us to control the output
    of google tests easier.
  + CHANGELOG_2.3: Added this CHANGELOG file to keep track of changes as
    we make them. We can then more easily write a CHANGELOG file when we
    release the code.

2013-03-22     Michael Beyeler <mbeyeler@uci.edu>

Build 2.1.3
---------------------

2013-10-31      Michael Beyeler <mbeyeler@uci.edu>
  * examples/v1MTLIP/main_v1MTLIP.cpp: corrected name of LIP group, fixed
    weights MT PDS -> LIP
  + examples/v1MTLIP/v1ColorME.cu (freeAllCUDA): added
  * scripts/v1MTLIP/plotRDKdecision.m: corrected name of LIP spike file, added
    some comments
  * snn_cpu.cpp (deleteObjects): fixed memory leaks (due to un-freed
    dynamically allocated structures)
  + snn_gpu.cu (deleteObjectsGPU): added, fixed memory leaks on GPU side
  + snn_gpu.cu (CpuSNNinitGPUparams): added, correctly instantiates global
    vars on GPU side


---------------------
Build 2.1.2
---------------------

2013-10-09      Michael Beyeler <mbeyeler@uci.edu>
  * snn_cpu.cpp (CpuSNN::setSpikeMonitor): if spike subdirectory does not
    exist, display error message and exit.
    If option CREATE_SPIKEDIR_IF_NOT_EXISTS is set in config.h, will attempt
    to create subdirectory (e.g., "Results/random", but NOT "Results")
  + config.h: added option CREATE_SPIKEDIR_IF_NOT_EXISTS (default: disabled)
  * Makefile: fixed header dependencies
  * examples: fixed path to spike files


---------------------
Build 2.1.1
---------------------

2013-10-04      Michael Beyeler <mbeyeler@uci.edu>
  * scripts/v1MTLIP/plotSpeed.m: fixed a bug concerning the plotting of the
    speed tuning curve for a particular MT neuron; added a comment on the
    location within the visual field of the chosen neuron
  * scripts/v1MTLIP/plotRDKdecision.m: fixed number of spikes per neuron
  + scripts/v1MTLIP: added "common" folder to path
  * examples/v1MTLIP/main_v1MTLIP.cpp (connectMTtoMTpatt): fixed RF size
    thresholding gausPos
  * Makefile: fixed error where v1ColorME.cu should read v1ColorMEold.cu
  * snn.h: fixed version numbering
  * RELEASE_NOTES: fixed version numbering
  + CHANGELOG: added

---------------------
Build 2.1.0
---------------------
2013-07-31      Michael Beyeler <mbeyeler@uci.edu>
  + examples/v1MTLIP/main_v1MTLIP.cpp: added complete source code to run
    motion energy model in COBA on CPU/GPU
  + scripts/v1MTLIP: added analysis scripts for motion energy model
  * scripts/common: moved previous commonly used analysis scripts to this
    folder
  + snn_cpu.cpp (CpuSNN::runNetwork): added option to specify on which CUDA
    card to establish a context
    The first time you run sim.runNetwork() add an int ithGPU that specifies
    the device index.
    > bool onGPU=true; // GPU mode on
    > int ithGPU=2; // run on the third card
    > sim.runNetwork(0,0,onGPU?GPU_MODE:CPU_MODE,ithGPU);
    If ithGPU is invalid (e.g., exceeds the number of cards), it defaults to
    using device 0.
  + snn_cpu.cpp (CpuSNN::allocateSNN_GPU): added GPU memory management summary
    At beginning of simulation, prints how many cards are available, which
    one has the most GFLOPs, on which card you're running your experiment,
    how much memory is available, etc.
  * snn_cpu.cpp (CpuSNN::printSimSummary): number of (actual vs. allocated)
    synapses
  * snn_cpu.cpp (CpuSNN::globalStateUpdate): fixed storing of current[] when
    running COBA in CPU mode; capped conductances to prevent instability
  * snn_cpu.cpp: fixed integer overflow issues for largest-scale simulations
  * snn_gpu.cu: fixed GPU memory allocation for fixed-weight simulations
  + scripts/common/readSpikes.m: added functionality to return spikes in AER
    format
  + scripts/common/readSpikesAERtoFull.m: added; expands an AER representation
    of <spike time/neuron ID> to a full matrix
  * scripts/common/readNetwork.m: fixed indexing issue (0-indexed)
  * v1ColorME.cu: edge effects removed in CUDA, reproduces V1 contrast
    sensitivity function, features scaling factors from Simoncelli & Heeger,
    1998
  * config.h: changed max. firing rate from 1000 Hz to 520 Hz
